    <p>It is a html/css/js project, meant to work offline due to company restraints.</p>

    <a href="https://github.com/dahuatool/GPTintegration"><h2>Custom chatGPT 3.5 chatbot</h2></a>
    <p>This is a Flask webapp that connects to OpenAI API and spawns a new bot with a prompt that changes the personality to someone previously chosen. It also allows the user to remove the vulgar language filter at any time.</p>
    <p>It is python based, uses the flask and OpenAI libraries to work. Several prompts are preinjected in the bot in order to make the personality changes and the filter option available.</p>
    <p>It is hosted at https://pagano.pythonanywhere.com/ but it is currently not operational due to a lack of OpenAI key. The code is still available <a href="https://github.com/dahuatool/GPTintegration/blob/main/chatbot35.py">here</a>.</p>
